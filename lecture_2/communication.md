## Communication

##### Before class

* Install an IRC client (such as xchat)

##### Using IRC

* Reading: [here](https://quaid.fedorapeople.org/TOS/Practical_Open_Source_Software_Exploration/html/sn-Lay_of_the_Land-IRC.html)
* IRC is for short questions about the code - not small talk, not architecture, and not bug reports
* Most of the time there are no server-kept logs of IRC chats

##### Mailing lists

* Mailing lists are just email chains (the same listservs you've signed up for at Duke)
* They do have some [etiquette](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/linux-and-open-source/open-source-etiquette/), however
* These are used for discussion of features, patches, how to solve bugs, etc

##### Open-source communications

* The important thing to remember is that almost everyone is a volunteer, and can walk away at any time
* This means that you should be polite
* It also means you can't force anyone to do something for you (and nobody can force you to do something)
* Linus Torvalds sends emails [like this](https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/12/23/75), but he sends those to people he already knows and trusts - the Linux mailing lists are much more welcoming to new contributors (and he receives a lot of criticism for his angry emails). He is also Linus Torvalds, and you are not

##### Working in a team

* Team skills presentation
