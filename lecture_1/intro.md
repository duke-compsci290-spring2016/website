## Introduction to Open Source

### Course outline

##### Bootcamp (first four weeks)

The goal of this unit is to find a project and to prepare you for submitting patches to an open source project. Topics include:

* Advanced Git usage
* Using Linux and the command line
* Using build tools, building software from the command line
* Communicating with project contributors
* Using bug trackers

##### Later topics

Later topics are focused on filling in everything that isn't immediately necessary to write code. They cover the technical, social, and organizational aspects of open-source software. They include:

* Project planning and development methodologies (Scrum, agile)
* Advanced build software, continuous integration
* Software testing
* Code reviews
* Open source licenses
* The culture and history of open-source
* Design principles of open-source software
* The security of open-source software

### But first...

We need to talk about what open source actually is. What do you think the term "open-source" means?

##### FLOSS

* FLOSS (Free, Libre, Open-Source Software) is seen as 
    * Free as in beer (it doesn't cost money)
    * Free as in freedom (you can examine it, change it, redistribute it, and redistribute your changed versions - the so-called [four freedoms](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html))

##### Some people have differing views on open source software

* OSI (Open Source Initiative) and FSF (Free Software Foundation)
* Linus Torvalds and Richard Stallman
* Many of these arguments are from clashes of ideology, practicality, and convenience. Here are some contentions in the open source software world:
    * Open source software as a business
    * Requiring all software that interacts with your software to also be open source software 

##### Homework before next class

* Install an IRC client (such as xchat) - more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat)
