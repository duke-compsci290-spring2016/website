## Bug tracking

##### Bug tracking

* Most open-source projects have a bug tracker - a single place that they use to track all of the bugs that users encounter, and often the same place they use to plan for features
* (Some small open-source projects hosted entirely on GitHub just use GitHub issues)
* [Reading](http://producingoss.com/en/bug-tracker.html)

##### Writing good bug reports

* Anyone can use a bug tracker to submit a bug report - and bug trackers are the correct place for them (as opposed to IRC or mailing lists)
* [Here](https://issues.apache.org/bugwritinghelp.html) are guidelines from the Apache project for writing a good bug report
* The best bug reports are reproducible by the developers - if they can't reproduce the problem, they can't fix the problem

##### What do you think about these bug reports?

* When you're reading these bug reports, think about:
    * Is the title descriptive of the problem?
    * What information is included? Do you think this is enough to reproduce the problem?
    * Do you think that this bug will be fixed? Why/why not?

* These reports we'll look at in class:
    * [bug 1](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=735598)
    * [bug 2](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=748713)
    * [bug 3](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=748706) - Note that this is posted by the maintainer of the project!
    * [bug 4](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=748732)
    * [bug 5](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=748711)
