## OpenHatch

##### What is OpenHatch?

* Hey, go check it out - [openhatch.org](openhatch.org)
* We are using it to find a list of bugs that open-source projects have submitted that should be relatively easy for new contributors

##### Here's an example

* [This bug](https://github.com/openspending/openspending/issues/690) was reported in a project
* The bug was labeled as relatively easy and crossposted to OpenHatch (since it was about removing unused imports - a relatively easy task)
* But the developers didn't automatically fix this easy task - they left it so someone new could get involved!
* A new developer made a patch, but it didn't work the first time
* The maintainer offered encouragement, clarification, and an offer for further help on IRC
* See - getting involved is easier than you think!

##### Your task

* Go to [https://openhatch.org/search/](https://openhatch.org/search/)
* Choose a language that you know already
* Browse by project - do some research on the projects to find out what they do
* Any project with 200+ bugs on OpenHatch is a poor candidate because it's likely that they post every single bug on OpenHatch instead of choosing specific ones that are good for new contributors. Don't waste your time looking unless you can't find any other bugs to fix
* Some bugs on OpenHatch have already been fixed - make sure to check for that
* Don't pick a bug older than a year old - sometimes the bugs have become irrelevant in the meantime
* Start fixing it! Don't be afraid to ask for help, over IRC/mailing list/bug trackers

##### Deliverables

* You're not expected to finish this in class - but you should turn in a one-page markdown page with your experience:
    * A link to the bug
    * A 1-sentence description of the project
    * A short description of what the bug was, and how you fixed it
    * Who did you contact for help/guidance (if any), and how did you contact them? How was it useful, and how do you wish it could have been more useful?
